        <div id="introduction">
            <p>Social media, despite its benefits, exposes users, especially teenagers, to manipulation tactics used to steal personal information or account access. A report by the Global Cybersecurity Forum (GCF) reveals that 72% of children worldwide have faced at least one type of cyber threat, highlighting the urgent need for protecting children online as over 90% of children aged eight and above are active on the internet (Cyber Magazine, 2022).</p>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('statement-of-problem')">Statement of Problem</h2>
        <div id="statement-of-problem">
            <p>Attackers trick users, especially teenagers who are highly active online, na√Øve, and lack adequate knowledge, into giving away personal information or control of accounts. This leads to identity theft, financial loss, and even ruined reputations (Naz et al., 2024). Attackers often use information from social media profiles, such as birthdays, locations, and interests, to craft highly personalized lures that appear legitimate (Jain et al., 2021).</p>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('aim')">Aim</h2>
        <div id="aim">
            <p>The aim of this study is to empower teenagers on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp with adequate knowledge to identify and protect themselves from cyberattacks through a Cyber Security Awareness Mobile Game.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('objectives')">Objectives</h2>
        <div id="objectives">
            <ul>
                <li>Design a cyber security awareness mobile game.</li>
                <li>Implement the cyber security awareness mobile game.</li>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('conclusion')">Conclusion</h2>
        <div id="conclusion">
            <p>The TeenSecure gamified approach significantly boosted teenagers' awareness of cyberattacks, improving the pass rate from 30% in the pre-quiz to 80% in the post-quiz. Research supports the superior effectiveness of games over videos for learning. Studies by Alshammari et al. (2015) and Becker et al. (2005) highlight how games create interactive, immersive environments that enhance problem-solving and cognitive skills, making them more effective than passive learning tools like videos. Granic et al. (2014) further emphasizes the positive effects of video games on mental health and cognitive development, showcasing the advantages of gamified learning in cybersecurity education.</p>
